##Introduction
I like fantasy football but there are some things that have always bothered me about it. First, standard scoring is not fun if you don't have a good Running Back because they always are the bell-cows for the team. Second, PPR tends to reverse that and make the Running Backs more of an afterthought. 

I have been working to develop an addition to skill position scoring that both rewards efficiency for the position and equalizes the points scored by each position group. To do this the goal is to create a point adjustment for each group that will give a small positive or negative adjustment for each skill that will be both 
weighted around the skill
